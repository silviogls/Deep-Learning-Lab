Usage example employing Lasagne for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

This example is deliberately structured as a long flat file, focusing on how
to use Lasagne, instead of focusing on writing maximally modular and reusable
code. It is used as the foundation for the introductory Lasagne tutorial:

# ############################# Batch iterator ###############################
# This is just a simple helper function iterating over training data in
# mini-batches of a particular size, optionally in random order. It assumes
# data is available as numpy arrays. For big datasets, you could load numpy
# arrays as memory-mapped files (np.load(..., mmap_mode='r')), or write your
# own custom data iteration function. For small datasets, you can also copy
# them to GPU at once for slightly improved performance. This would involve
# several changes in the main program, though, and is not demonstrated here.
# Notice that this function returns only mini-batches of size `batchsize`.
# If the size of the data is not a multiple of `batchsize`, it will not
# return the last (remaining) mini-batch.
